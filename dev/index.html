Fabriquer's code and issue tracker are kept on [GitHub]({{ site.repo }}).
Pull requests (and other forms of code contribution) are very welcome!

Support tools
-------------
We currently use the [GitHub]({{ site.repo }}) issue tracker and code review
system, but are thinking about switching to
[Gerrit](https://code.google.com/p/gerrit/).
We don't use any continuous integration at the moment, but would like to
change that in the future.
